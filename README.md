# Data Science Analysis of Hyatt Hotel Chain

The aim of the project is to analyse the customer data provided by the Hyatt chain of hotels and provide them with actionable insights that will enable them to improve customer satisfaction. Since their revenue stream depends solely on their customers, it is important to understand why customers get classified as promoters, passives or detractors.
